# NBA.com default edition setter, for Australians: Firefox version

When accessing NBA.com from Australia, you are redirected to sportingnews.com/au/nba, which is a terrible website. You can change the default edition to the American NBA.com, but as any Australian who frequents NBA.com knows, you need to repeat this action every week, because the preference expires after 7 days, and this annoys me to no end.

For years this has caused me great anguish, and finally I've had enough... Born out of my burning hatred for sportingnews.com is this extension which will eliminate the need to ever manually set your default nba.com version again.

## Installation
#### This is the Firefox version, for Chrome/Chromium, go to the [main branch](https://github.com/maxgoodwin/nba.com-default-edition-setter/tree/main)
You can install via [Firefox addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nba-com-au-to-usa/), or install it per the instructions below:

1. Download/clone this repo
2. Open firefox/firefox based browser
3. Go to add-ons and themes settings
4. Click the gear cog in the top right. Click 'Install Add-on From File'
5. Select any file within this repo
6. Enable the extension and enjoy

## How to use

All you need to do is install and enable the extension and you are done.
There are however a couple of extra things you can do in the extension popup (open by clicking on the extension in your extension tray):

- **Reset**: This will reset the relevant sportingnews.com and nba.com cookies that control which site you are redirected to.
- **On/off switch**: Enabled by default, this switch can be used to disable and enable the extension. The state of this will be saved to your Google account, so it will sync across devices.
